        "# Introduction to PCA\n",
        "\n",
        "PCA is used for dimensionality reduction. This notebook is based on [In Depth: Principal Component Analysis](https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook/05.09-principal-component-analysis.html), with extensions to show what PCA means in practice.\n",
        "\n",
        "PCA is a relatively advanced technique for feature engineering. It is used when there is a lot of collinearity between the features, but it is difficult to decide which features to drop.\n",
        "\n",
        "PCA takes a set of $n$ features and generates a scaled and rotated set of $p$ features, where $p < n$.\n",
        "The features derived by PCA are called the _Principal Components_ of the original features.\n",
        "For example, size and weight might be heavily correlated (highly collinear) features. We could drop one or the other. PCA derives a new feature which has elements of both `size` _and_ `weight`, and which might be a better predictor than either `size` or `weight` on their own.\n",
        "\n",
        "We will cover PCA (and how it works) in class. for the moment, it is enough just to see it in action in this notebook."
