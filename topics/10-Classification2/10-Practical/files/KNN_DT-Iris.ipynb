However, it is probably more convenient to use a `dot` postprocessor (`pydotplus`) directly from within the notebook to create an object that can be displayed in the notebook, or saved to a file as below."

While this improves the entropy (the child nodes have entropy 0.446 and 0.179), each of them requires further recursive splitiing.
